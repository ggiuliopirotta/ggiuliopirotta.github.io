title: "Flight cancellations classification"
excerpt: "Classification problem with a massive dataset."
collection: portfolio

In this data mining class, we had to conduct an analysis with some business application.  
The dataset chosen was clean, but massive, forcing us to take a subsample of it.

To increase the number of useful features:

- Airport-specific weather information üå§Ô∏è was gathered from an API
- Additional feature engineering was performed

It finally required further subsampling, as it was unbalanced ‚öñÔ∏è towards non-canceled flights,  
but the model should not develop any bias.
