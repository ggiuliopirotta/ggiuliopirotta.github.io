In this project, I built and compared two speech recognition models: \
a classic multilayer perceptron agsinst a recurrent network.

Main challenges:
- applying cepstral normalization and other preprocessing techniques to the data
- giving enough context to the model

Unfortunately, I lost the performances for the RNN, \
but here are the results for the MLP.
