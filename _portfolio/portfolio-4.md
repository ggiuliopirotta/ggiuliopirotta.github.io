The scope of this project was to build a convolutional neural network for image recognition.  
Specifically, the images pictured human faces, with the model being trained to  
both detect and verify the identity.

Main challenges:
- using data augmentation to increase the size of the dataset
- improving the model's performances for both tasks at the same time
- testing multiple architectures

Here are the results:
